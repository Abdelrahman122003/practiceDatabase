### Best Structure and Practices for Writing SQL:

1. **Use Uppercase for SQL Keywords**: Keywords like `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `JOIN`, etc., are typically written in uppercase to improve readability and distinguish them from column names and table names.

2. **Indentation**: Properly indent your SQL code to make it more readable, especially when dealing with multiple lines in `SELECT`, `JOIN`, or `WHERE` clauses. This helps identify the different parts of the query easily.

3. **Commenting**: Use comments to explain what each part of the query is doing. This is especially important in complex queries to help others (or yourself) understand the logic. Comments can be written using `--` for single-line comments or `/* */` for block comments.

4. **Descriptive Aliases**: When using table aliases (like `e` and `b`), make sure they are meaningful, especially in more complex queries. Short but clear names like `e` for `Employee` and `b` for `Bonus` are good.

5. **Join Conditions and Where Clause**: Always make sure your `JOIN` conditions are clear and that filters in the `WHERE` clause are correct. Avoid putting join conditions in the `WHERE` clause unless it's necessary (e.g., in `INNER JOIN`).

6. **Logical Grouping**: Use parentheses in complex conditions to group logical operations (`AND`, `OR`) clearly.

7. **Avoid Using SELECT \***: It's best to explicitly list the columns you need rather than using `SELECT *`. This improves performance and makes the query more efficient by retrieving only the required data.

By following these practices, your SQL queries will be more readable, maintainable, and easier to understand.

## SQL Naming Conventions:

1. **Tables**: Plural, snake_case (e.g., `employees`, `order_items`).
2. **Columns**: Singular, descriptive, snake_case (e.g., `first_name`, `order_total`).
3. **Primary Keys**: Use `id` or `table_name_id` (e.g., `employee_id`).
4. **Foreign Keys**: Use `referenced_table_name_id` (e.g., `customer_id`).
5. **Indexes**: Use `idx_table_name_column_name` (e.g., `idx_employee_name`).
6. **Views/Temp Tables**: Use descriptive names (`active_orders_view`, `tmp_sales_data`).
7. **Aliases**: Short, meaningful, and clear (`e` for employees, `p` for products).
8. **Stored Procedures/Functions**: Use action verbs (`sp_create_employee`, `get_order_details`).
9. **Keywords**: Uppercase (`SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`).
