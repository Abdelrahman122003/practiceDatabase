```sql
-- Select the names of employees who are managers and have at least 5 direct reports.
SELECT
    e.name -- Fetch the name of the employee who meets the criteria.
FROM
    Employee e -- The main Employee table is referred to as 'e'.
INNER JOIN
(
    -- Create a subquery to count the number of employees reporting to each manager.
    SELECT
        *, -- Select all columns from the Employee table (not ideal; specify columns if possible).
        COUNT(e.managerId) AS report_num -- Count the number of employees for each manager.
    FROM
        Employee e -- Use the Employee table to group data by managers.
    GROUP BY
        managerId -- Group employees by their manager's ID to calculate the count.
) AS Mang_report -- Alias the subquery result as 'Mang_report'.
ON
    e.id = Mang_report.managerId -- Match the manager's ID in the main table with the IDs in the subquery.
    AND
    Mang_report.report_num >= 5; -- Only include managers with 5 or more direct reports.
