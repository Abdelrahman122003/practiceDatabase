### PROBLEM NAME: Consecutive Numbers

**`Solution1`**

```sql
SELECT
     DISTINCT a.num AS ConsecutiveNums -- Selecting unique numbers that appear consecutively at least three times
FROM
    Logs a, -- Alias 'a' refers to one instance of the Logs table
    Logs b, -- Alias 'b' refers to the next row after 'a' (a consecutive row)
    Logs c  -- Alias 'c' refers to the row after 'b' (two steps ahead of 'a')
WHERE
    a.id = b.id - 1 -- Ensures that 'b' is the next row after 'a' based on consecutive IDs
    AND
    a.num = b.num -- Checks that the numbers in 'a' and 'b' are the same
    AND
    b.id = c.id - 1 -- Ensures that 'c' is the next row after 'b' (two consecutive rows after 'a')
    AND
    b.num = c.num; -- Checks that the numbers in 'b' and 'c' are the same
