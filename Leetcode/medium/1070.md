### PROBLEM NAME: Product Sales Analysis III

**`Solution1`**

```sql
SELECT
    s.product_id,
    s.year AS first_year,
    s.quantity,
    s.price
FROM
    Sales s,
    (
        SELECT
            product_id,
            MIN(year) AS first_year
        FROM
            Sales
        GROUP BY product_id
    ) AS first_year_per_product
WHERE
    s.product_id = first_year_per_product.product_id
    AND
    s.year = first_year_per_product.first_year;
```

**`Solution2`**

```sql
-- Select the columns to display in the result: product_id, the first year of sale (as first_year),
-- quantity of products sold, and the price of the product.
SELECT
  product_id,
  year AS first_year, -- Alias 'year' as 'first_year' for better readability in the result.
  quantity,
  price
FROM
  Sales
WHERE
  -- Filter rows in the Sales table to include only those where the combination of product_id and year
  -- matches the result of the subquery.
  (product_id, year) IN (
    -- Subquery: Find the first sale year for each product.
    SELECT
      product_id,              -- Select product_id to group sales by product.
      MIN(year) AS year        -- For each product_id, find the minimum year (earliest sale year).
    FROM
      Sales
    GROUP BY
      product_id               -- Ensure that the results are grouped by each unique product_id.
  );

```

**Order Matters in Tuples**:

- `(product_id, year)` in the `WHERE` clause must match the order of columns in the subquery result.
