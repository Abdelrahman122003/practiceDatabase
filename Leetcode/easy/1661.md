### PROBLEM NAME: Average Time of Process per Machine

**`Solution1`**

```sql
SELECT
    machine_id,  -- Select the machine_id to calculate the average processing time for each machine
    ROUND(AVG(end_time - start_time), 3) AS processing_time  -- Calculate the average processing time for each machine, rounded to 3 decimal places
FROM

    (
        SELECT
            machine_id,  -- Group by machine_id to calculate times for each machine
            process_id,  -- Group by process_id to ensure we handle each process separately
            MAX(CASE WHEN activity_type = 'end' THEN timestamp ELSE NULL END) AS end_time,  -- Get the 'end' timestamp (using MAX to handle possible multiple 'end' entries for each process)
            MAX(CASE WHEN activity_type = 'start' THEN timestamp ELSE NULL END) AS start_time  -- Get the 'start' timestamp (using MAX to handle multiple 'start' entries)
        FROM
            Activity  -- The main table containing machine activity data
        GROUP BY
            machine_id,  -- Group by machine_id to calculate the processing time for each machine
            process_id  -- Group by process_id to ensure we get time calculations for each process separately
    ) AS ProcessTimes  -- Subquery that calculates start and end times for each process on each machine
GROUP BY
    machine_id;  -- Group by machine_id to calculate the overall average processing time per machine
```

**`Solution2`**

```sql
SELECT
    a.machine_id,  -- Select the machine_id (the final result will be grouped by machine_id)
    ROUND(AVG(b.timestamp - a.timestamp), 3) AS processing_time  -- Calculate the average processing time per machine, rounded to 3 decimal places
FROM
    Activity a,  -- Alias 'a' for the Activity table (represents the 'start' activity)
    Activity b   -- Alias 'b' for the Activity table (represents the 'end' activity)
WHERE
    a.machine_id = b.machine_id  -- Join the two instances of the Activity table on machine_id
AND
    a.process_id = b.process_id  -- Join the two instances of the Activity table on process_id (same process)
AND
    a.activity_type = 'start'
AND
    b.activity_type = 'end'
GROUP BY machine_id;  -- Group the result by machine_id to calculate the average processing time per machine

```

**`Solution3`**

```sql
SELECT
    machine_id,
    ROUND(
        SUM(
            CASE
                WHEN activity_type = 'start'
                THEN timestamp * -1  -- Multiply the 'start' timestamp by -1 to handle negative times
                ELSE timestamp       -- Leave the 'end' timestamp as it is
            END
        ) * 1.0 / (  -- Multiply by 1.0 to ensure floating point division
            (
                SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT process_id)  -- Count the number of unique processes across all activities
                FROM Activity
            )
        , 3) AS processing_time  -- Round the result to 3 decimal places
FROM
    Activity
GROUP BY
    machine_id;  -- Group by machine_id to calculate processing time for each machine
```
