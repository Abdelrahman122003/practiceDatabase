### PROBLEM NAME: Students and Examinations

```sql
-- Step 1: Generate all combinations of students and subjects using CROSS JOIN
-- This will create a Cartesian product where each student is paired with every subject.
SELECT
    Result1.student_id,
    Result1.student_name,
    Result1.subject_name,
    COALESCE(Result2.attended_exams, 0) AS attended_exams  -- Step 3: Use COALESCE to ensure 0 is shown if no matching record in Examinations
FROM
(
    -- Step 1: Creating Result1 by CROSS JOIN between Students and Subjects
    -- This step produces all possible combinations of student_id and subject_name.
    SELECT
        s.student_id,
        s.student_name,
        sub.subject_name
    FROM
        Students s
    CROSS JOIN
        Subjects sub
) AS Result1

-- Step 2: Aggregate data from Examinations table
-- Group the data by student_id and subject_name, counting how many times each student has attended a specific subject.
LEFT OUTER JOIN
(
    SELECT
        e.student_id,
        e.subject_name,
        COUNT(e.subject_name) AS attended_exams  -- Counting the number of times each student attended a subject
    FROM
        Examinations e
    GROUP BY
        e.student_id,
        e.subject_name  -- Grouping by student_id and subject_name to get the count for each subject
) AS Result2
ON Result1.student_id = Result2.student_id
    AND Result1.subject_name = Result2.subject_name  -- Join on student_id and subject_name to match the records

-- Step 3: Final result is ordered by student_id, student_name, and subject_name
ORDER BY
    student_id,
    student_name,
    subject_name;
