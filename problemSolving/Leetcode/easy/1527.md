### PROBLEM NAME:

**`Solution1 => Using LIKE`**

```SQL
SELECT
    patient_id,
    patient_name,
    conditions
FROM
    Patients
WHERE
    conditions LIKE "DIAB1%" OR conditions LIKE "% DIAB1%";

```

**`Solution2 => using regular experssion`**

```sql
-- The regular expression `(^| )DIAB1` matches the string `DIAB1` when it either appears at the **start of the string** (`^`) or is **preceded by a space** (`|` represents OR), ensuring that `DIAB1` is treated as a distinct word, not part of a longer word.
SELECT * FROM patients WHERE conditions REGEXP '(^| )DIAB1'
```
