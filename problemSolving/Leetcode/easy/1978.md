### PROBLEM NAME: Employees Whose Manager Left the Company

**`MySolution => Subqueries`**

```sql
SELECT
    employee_filtered.employee_id
FROM
(
    SELECT
    employee_id,
    manager_id
    FROM
        Employees
    WHERE salary < 30000
          AND manager_id IS NOT NULL
)AS employee_filtered
WHERE (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Employees e  WHERE employee_filtered.manager_id = e.employee_id) = 0
ORDER BY employee_id;
```

**`Solution => Using Left Join`**

```sql
SELECT
    e.employee_id
FROM
    Employees e
LEFT JOIN
    Employees m ON e.manager_id = m.employee_id
WHERE
    e.salary < 30000
    AND e.manager_id IS NOT NULL
    AND m.employee_id IS NULL
ORDER BY
    e.employee_id;

```
