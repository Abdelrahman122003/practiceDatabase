### PROBLEM NAME: Average Selling Price

**`Solution`**

```sql
SELECT
    p.product_id,  -- Selects the product ID from the Prices table
     COALESCE(ROUND(SUM(p.price * u.units) / SUM(u.units), 2), 0.00) AS average_price
     -- COALESCE(..., 0.00): Ensures that if the weighted average price is NULL (e.g., no units sold for the product), it defaults to 0.00.
FROM
    Prices p
LEFT JOIN
    UnitsSold u
ON
    p.product_id = u.product_id  -- Matches products from Prices and UnitsSold tables by product ID
    AND p.start_date <= u.purchase_date  -- Ensures the purchase date is within the price validity range
    AND p.end_date >= u.purchase_date  -- Ensures the purchase date is within the price validity range
GROUP BY
    p.product_id;  -- Groups the results by product ID to calculate the average price per product
```
