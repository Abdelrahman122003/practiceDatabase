### PROBLEM NAME: Delete Duplicate Emails

**`Solution`**

```SQL
DELETE p1 -- Deletes duplicate records from the table, specifically the ones with a higher `id`.
FROM Person p, Person p1 -- Performs a self-join on the `Person` table.
WHERE p.email = p1.email -- Identifies duplicate rows based on the `email` column.
      AND
      p.id < p1.id; -- Keeps the record with the smaller `id` and deletes the others with larger `id`.

```
