### PROBLEM NAME: Primary Department for Each Employee

**`Solution1 => Union Approach`**

```sql
(
    -- Select employees who appear in only one department.
    SELECT
        e.employee_id,       -- The unique identifier for the employee.
        e.department_id      -- The department associated with the employee.
    FROM
        Employee e           -- Source table containing employee data.
    GROUP BY
        e.employee_id        -- Group by employee_id to aggregate counts for each employee.
    HAVING
        COUNT(*) = 1         -- Filter to include only employees who belong to exactly one department.
)
UNION
(
    -- Select employees marked as primary (primary_flag = 'Y'), even if they belong to multiple departments.
    SELECT
        e.employee_id,       -- The unique identifier for the employee.
        e.department_id      -- The department associated with the employee.
    FROM
        Employee e           -- Source table containing employee data.
    WHERE
        e.primary_flag = 'Y' -- Include only employees where the primary_flag is 'Y'.
    GROUP BY
        e.employee_id,       -- Group by employee_id to ensure unique results.
        e.primary_flag       -- Include primary_flag in the GROUP BY as it is used in the SELECT clause.
)
```

**`Solution2 => Window Function (COUNT) Approach`**

```sql
-- Select the employee ID and department ID from the filtered results.
SELECT
    employee_id,        -- The unique identifier for each employee.
    department_id       -- The identifier for the department the employee belongs to.
FROM
    (
        -- Create a derived table with additional calculated information.
        SELECT
            *,                                        -- Select all columns from the Employee table.
            COUNT(employee_id) OVER(PARTITION BY employee_id) AS employee_count
                                                    -- Calculate the count of rows for each employee ID
                                                    -- using a window function. The result will be included
                                                    -- as a new column `employee_count` in the derived table.
        FROM
            Employee                                -- Source table containing employee data.
    ) employee_parition                             -- Alias for the derived table.
WHERE
    employee_count = 1                              -- Filter to include only employees who appear exactly once.
    OR
    primary_flag = 'Y';                             -- Additionally include employees where the primary_flag is 'Y'.

```
