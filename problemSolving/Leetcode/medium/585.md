**`Solution`**

```sql
SELECT
    -- Round the sum of tiv_2016 to 2 decimal places and return it as tiv_2016
    ROUND(SUM(tiv_2016), 2) AS tiv_2016
FROM
(
    SELECT
        -- Count how many times each (lat, lon) pair appears in the table.
        -- This checks whether the (lat, lon) location is unique for each row.
        COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY lat, lon) AS location_count,
        -- Count how many times each tiv_2015 value appears in the table.
        -- This checks whether the tiv_2015 value appears more than once (for duplicates).
        COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY tiv_2015) AS dupl_tiv_2015_count,

        -- Select the tiv_2015 value for each row to check if it satisfies the condition
        tiv_2015,

        -- Select the tiv_2016 value for each row to sum up later if the conditions are met
        tiv_2016
    FROM
        Insurance  -- Data comes from the Insurance table
) AS counter  -- The subquery is aliased as 'counter'

-- Apply the conditions to filter the rows
WHERE
    -- Only include rows where the tiv_2015 value appears more than once (duplicate tiv_2015 values)
    dupl_tiv_2015_count > 1

    -- Only include rows where the (lat, lon) pair is unique, meaning it appears only once
    AND location_count = 1;
