### PROBLEM NAME: Confirmation Rate

**`Solution1(MySolution)`**

```sql
SELECT
    s.user_id,
    -- ROUND the result to 2 decimal places and use COALESCE to return 0.00 if the result is NULL
    COALESCE(ROUND(num_action_confirmed / num_confirmations * 1.0, 2), 0.00) AS confirmation_rate

-- From the Signups table (alias s)
FROM
    Signups s
LEFT OUTER JOIN
(
    -- Subquery to calculate the number of confirmations and confirmed actions per user
    SELECT
        DISTINCT user_id,
        -- Count total number of confirmations for each user
        COUNT(user_id) AS num_confirmations,
        -- Count the number of 'confirmed' actions for each user
        COUNT(CASE WHEN action = 'confirmed' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS num_action_confirmed
    FROM
        Confirmations
    GROUP BY
        user_id
) AS cf  -- Alias for the subquery
ON s.user_id = cf.user_id;

```

**`Solution2`**

```sql
SELECT
    s.user_id,

    -- Calculate the confirmation rate by averaging the 'confirmed' actions (1 for confirmed, 0 for others)
    -- The ROUND function is used to round the result to 2 decimal places
    ROUND(AVG(IF(c.action = 'confirmed', 1, 0)), 2) AS confirmation_rate
FROM
    Signups s
LEFT JOIN
    Confirmations c
ON
    s.user_id = c.user_id
-- Group the result by user_id to calculate the confirmation rate for each user individually
GROUP BY
    s.user_id;
```
