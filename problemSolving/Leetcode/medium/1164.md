### PROBLEM NAME: Product Price at a Given Date

**`Solution1 => Using Left Join`**

```sql
SELECT
    unique_products.product_id, -- Selecting the unique product IDs
    IFNULL(calculated_prices.price, 10) AS price -- If no price change is found, use the default price (10)
FROM
(
    SELECT
        DISTINCT product_id -- Get unique product IDs from the Products table
    FROM
        Products
) AS unique_products -- Alias for the subquery that retrieves unique product IDs
LEFT JOIN
(
    SELECT
        p.product_id, -- Select product_id from the Products table
        p.new_price AS price -- Select the price from the Products table for the given product
    FROM
        Products p
    LEFT JOIN
    (
        SELECT
            product_id, -- Select product_id for the inner subquery
            MAX(change_date) AS latest_change_date -- Get the most recent change date for each product before '2019-08-16'
        FROM
            Products
        WHERE change_date <= '2019-08-16' -- Only consider changes before or on '2019-08-16'
        GROUP BY product_id -- Group by product_id to get the latest change date for each product
    ) AS latest_changes -- Alias for the subquery that finds the latest change date for each product
    ON latest_changes.product_id = p.product_id -- Join on product_id to match each product with its latest change date
    AND latest_changes.latest_change_date = p.change_date -- Ensure the change date is the latest for each product
    WHERE latest_changes.latest_change_date = p.change_date -- Ensure that only rows with the latest change date are included
) AS calculated_prices -- Alias for the subquery that calculates the price for each product
ON unique_products.product_id = calculated_prices.product_id; -- Left join to associate unique products with their calculated price

```

**`Solution2 => Using Union => Simple Solution`**

```sql
(
    SELECT
        p.product_id, -- Select the product ID
        p.new_price AS price -- Select the new price for the product
    FROM
        Products p
    LEFT JOIN
    (
        SELECT
            product_id, -- Select product ID
            MAX(change_date) AS res_date -- Find the most recent change date before or on '2019-08-16'
        FROM
            Products
        WHERE change_date <= '2019-08-16' -- Filter for changes on or before '2019-08-16'
        GROUP BY product_id -- Group by product ID to get the most recent change date for each product
    ) AS product_date
    ON product_date.product_id = p.product_id -- Join on product ID to match each product with its most recent change date
    AND p.change_date = product_date.res_date -- Ensure the change date matches the most recent date
    WHERE p.change_date = product_date.res_date -- Only include the row where the change date matches the most recent change
)
UNION
(
    SELECT
        product_id, -- Select the product ID
        10 AS price -- Set the default price to 10 for products with no changes before '2019-08-16'
    FROM
        Products
    GROUP BY product_id -- Group by product ID
    HAVING MIN(change_date) > '2019-08-16' -- Ensure that these products have no price changes before '2019-08-16'
)

```

**`Solution3 => Using Window Function`**

```sql
SELECT
  product_id, -- Select the product ID
  IFNULL(price, 10) AS price -- If no price change is found, use the default price of 10
FROM
  (
    SELECT DISTINCT
      product_id -- Get unique product IDs from the Products table
    FROM
      Products
  ) AS UniqueProducts -- Alias for the subquery that gets all distinct product IDs
  LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT DISTINCT
      product_id, -- Select the product ID
      FIRST_VALUE(new_price) OVER (
        PARTITION BY product_id -- Partition by product_id to get the first (most recent) value for each product
        ORDER BY change_date DESC -- Order by change_date in descending order to get the most recent change first
      ) AS price -- Use FIRST_VALUE to get the most recent price before '2019-08-16'
    FROM
      Products
    WHERE
      change_date <= '2019-08-16' -- Filter rows to only consider price changes before or on '2019-08-16'
  ) AS LastChangedPrice USING (product_id); -- Perform a LEFT JOIN with the UniqueProducts table using product_id to link the results

```
