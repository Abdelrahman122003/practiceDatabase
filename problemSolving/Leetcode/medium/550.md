### PROBLEM NAME: Game Play Analysis IV

**`My Solution`**

```sql
-- The main query calculates the fraction of players who logged in the day after their first login
SELECT
    -- ROUND function is used to round the fraction to 2 decimal places
    ROUND(COUNT(*) / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT player_id) FROM Activity), 2) AS fraction
FROM
    -- Main Activity table is aliased as 'a'
    Activity a,
    (
        -- This subquery calculates the first login date for each player
        SELECT
            player_id,
            MIN(event_date) AS first_date  -- MIN function is used to get the earliest login date (first login) for each player
        FROM
            Activity
        GROUP BY player_id  -- Grouping by player_id ensures each player's first login date is retrieved
    ) activity_group_by_player_id  -- Alias for the subquery result

WHERE
    -- Join condition to match players from both the Activity table and the subquery on player_id
    a.player_id = activity_group_by_player_id.player_id
    AND
    -- This condition checks if the player logged in exactly one day after their first login
    DATEDIFF(a.event_date, first_date) = 1;

```

**`optimized Solution`**

```sql
WITH FirstLogin AS (
    SELECT
        player_id,
        MIN(event_date) AS first_date
    FROM
        Activity
    GROUP BY player_id
)
SELECT
    ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT a.player_id) / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT player_id) FROM Activity), 2) AS fraction
FROM
    Activity a
JOIN
    FirstLogin fl ON a.player_id = fl.player_id
WHERE
    DATEDIFF(a.event_date, fl.first_date) = 1;
```
