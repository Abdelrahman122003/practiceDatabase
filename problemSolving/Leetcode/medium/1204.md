### PROBLEM NAME: Last Person to Fit in the Bus

**`MySolution => Using Window Function`**

```sql
SELECT
    person_name
FROM
(
    SELECT
        person_name,                -- The name of the person
        turn,                      -- The boarding order of the person
        weight,                    -- The weight of the person
        SUM(weight) OVER (         -- Calculate the running total (prefix sum) of weights
            ORDER BY turn          -- Order by the turn to ensure the weights are summed in the boarding sequence
        ) AS prefix_sum            -- Alias for the calculated prefix sum
    FROM
        Queue                      -- Source table containing the queue information
) AS Queue_with_sum                -- Alias for the subquery with the prefix sum
WHERE
    prefix_sum <= 1000             -- Filter to include only those rows where the cumulative weight doesn't exceed the bus limit
ORDER BY
    turn DESC                      -- Sort the valid rows in descending order of turn to find the last person who can board
LIMIT 1;                           -- Return only the top row, which corresponds to the last valid person

```

**`Solution => Using Join`**

```sql
SELECT
    q1.person_name                   -- Return the name of the person who can board the bus
FROM
    Queue q1                         -- Reference to the main table representing the current person (q1)
JOIN
    Queue q2                         -- Self-join with the same table to calculate cumulative weights
ON
    q1.turn >= q2.turn               -- Join condition: Include all rows (q2) with a turn less than or equal to the current person's turn (q1)
GROUP BY
    q1.turn                          -- Group by q1.turn to calculate cumulative weight for each person based on their turn
HAVING
    SUM(q2.weight) <= 1000           -- Filter groups where the cumulative weight (sum of weights up to the current turn) does not exceed 1000
ORDER BY
    SUM(q2.weight) DESC              -- Order the valid rows by cumulative weight in descending order to find the person closest to the weight limit
LIMIT 1;                             -- Return only the top row, which corresponds to the last valid person who can board

```
