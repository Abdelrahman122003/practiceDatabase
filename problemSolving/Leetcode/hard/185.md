```SQL
-- Common Table Expression (CTE) to generate employee details along with their department and ranking by salary
WITH employee_department AS (
    SELECT
        -- Select the employee's name
        e.name AS Employee,
        -- Select the department's name
        d.name AS Department,
        -- Select the employee's salary
        e.salary AS Salary,
        -- Use DENSE_RANK() to assign a rank to each employee within their department, ordered by salary in descending order
        DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY e.departmentId ORDER BY e.salary DESC) AS rnk
    FROM
        Employee e
    JOIN
        Department d
    ON
        e.departmentId = d.id  -- Join the Employee and Department tables based on the departmentId
)

-- Select the department, employee, and salary for the top 3 highest-paid employees in each department
SELECT
    Department,   -- Department name
    Employee,     -- Employee name
    Salary        -- Employee's salary
FROM
    employee_department  -- From the employee_department CTE
WHERE
    rnk <= 3;  -- Filter to include only the top 3 employees (rank <= 3) by salary in each department
